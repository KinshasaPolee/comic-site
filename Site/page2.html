          Iron Man, like knights of old, is identified by the armor he wears. The
          best-dressed of the Marvel heroes, he has changed his look frequently
          since his debut in 1963, but he can afford to: the man who wears the
          suits (and designs them) is wealthy inventor Tony Stark. So the man make
          the clothes, but do the clothes make the man?
          <br />
          Not only does Tony Stark have no super powers of his own, but the armor
          that gives him strength was also created to keep his damaged heart
          beating; he could not survive without his iron shell. Eventually his
          cardiac condition was corrected by a heart transplant, and a later that
          left him paralyzed was repaired with a microchip. So even without his
          high-tech costume Tony Stark is a mixture of man and machine, what
          science fiction writers call a cyborg.
          <br />
          Exactly who Stark might be without his armor is difficult to say. Writer
          Stan Lee and artist Don Heck initially presented him as a suave playboy,
          part of a long tradition of rich men who have become masked heroes. Yet
          unlike most of his predecessors, Stark got his income from a specific
          source: he manufactured and sold weapons. This was a slightly sinister
          occupation, despite its undoubted utility, and there were hints that
          Stark was ambivalent about his role. When his business was menaced by a
          hostile takeover in a 1979 storyline, he collapsed into alcoholism, and
          a friend was obliged to take over temporarily the job of Iron Man. So
          the suit an function without Stark, but can Stark function without the
          suit?
          <br />
          Stark publicly proclaims that Iron Man is his bodyguard, and to avoid
          prosecution for his own violence he once announced that the man in the
          suit had died and been replaced. He might have been talking about
          himself, since he is empowered by machinery and sustained by another
          man's heart. Beneath his polished veneer, Iron Man may be the most
          troubled of Marvel's heroes, forever fighting to prove that his armor is
          not hollow.
